#+title: My Emacs Config

/A minimal cross platform config./

This repository contains my minimal (but quite useful) Emacs config.

It is meant to provide a decent working environment that's fairly easy to manage.
In general, I try to use as many of the builtin features available and tend to only use external package when it's much more convenient.

Everything (along with commentary) is in the [[init.el]] file as hs-mode can sufficiently fold my config and a tangled config can be a lot harder to maintain properly.
Once I'm happy with the this config I may consider creating a literate config from it - mainly as an exercise to evaluate the usefulness of my configuration.
